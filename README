Explanation:
    To run the ExtractCollocation program, use:

    java -jar hadoopWorker.jar ExtractCollations heb/eng

Implementation:
    to get the top-100 collocations for each decade, we use 4 jobs:

    1. Split Words -
    2. Extract counts -
    3. Extract log ratio -
    4. Extract top collocations -

Notes:
    - after seeing the total counts of each decade, we splitted the decades between the reducers like this:

        numPartitions-1 highest decades will go each one to a specific reducer.
        the rest of the decades will go to the last partition that is not being used.

      That is because in the last decades there is much more information, and for our calculations
      each decade should go to the same reducer - so we cannot split decades between reducers.
