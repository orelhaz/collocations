Explanation:
    To run the ExtractCollocation program, use:

    java -jar hadoopWorker.jar ExtractCollations heb/eng

Implementation:
    to get the top-100 collocations for each decade, we use 4 jobs:

    1. Split Words - splits each 2-gram into two words, and also counts the
            number of appearances of each word, and the number of words in each decade.
    2. Extract counts - gets the counts from previous job, and put them in the
            same row as the 2-gram row.
    3. Extract log ratio - merge the rows, gets the second word's count and extract log ratio for each
            2-gram in decade.
    4. Extract top collocations - sorts the 2-grams by the log ratio score,
            and gets the top 100 2-grams in each decade.

Notes:
    - after seeing the total counts of each decade, we splitted the decades between the reducers like this:

        numPartitions-1 highest decades will go each one to a specific reducer.
        the rest of the decades will go to the last partition that is not being used.

      That is because in the last decades there is much more information, and for our calculations
      each decade should go to the same reducer - so we cannot split decades between reducers.
